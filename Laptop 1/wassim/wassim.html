        <h1>I read your article it kinda hurt me</h1>
        <h1>I don't know who hired you or what your friends say in your circle</h1>
        <h1></h1>But the fact that you released it, tells me two things are for certain</h1>
        <h1></h1>They get paid for trashin' people, I get paid cause I stay workin'</h1>
        <h1></h1>Drop the search and they emerge up out of nowhere to the surface</h1>
        <h1></h1>Just to peek behind the curtain, throwin' salt at all my burdens</h1>
        <h1></h1>I'm aware I shouldn't give this my attention, life's a journey</h1>
        <h1></h1>I should just stay on my path and learn to laugh</h1>
        <h1></h1>You think they heard me?</h1>
        <h1></h1>Ears are burning put 'em out, quiet quiet look around</h1>
        <h1></h1>Why don't they find someone way more interesting to write about?</h1>
        <h1></h1>Us we're kinda boring, aren't we?</h1>
        <h1></h1>All we do is whine and pout</h1>
        <h1></h1>It's confusing so amusing how I argue with myself (hello)</h1>
